## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated purple (#673AB7) for a modern and sophisticated feel, but avoiding trend-driven 'millennial' associations.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, to keep the focus on the content and data.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#2196F3), as an analogous color to purple that still offers contrast, for calls to action and important notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, known for being very legible at a variety of sizes, provides a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, outlined icons for navigation and actions. The style should be clean and modern to match the overall aesthetic.
- Employ a clear, grid-based layout with ample white space to prevent the interface from feeling cluttered. The structure should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, such as fading in new content or highlighting updated data.
